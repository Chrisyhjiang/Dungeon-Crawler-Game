For the demo, make sure to show:
- Whenever the game restarts or starts (not when the user quits (q)), the program prompts the user to select one of 5 races.
- If the player character tries to move toward a wall or invalid part of the floor map, enters an invalid command, or
  attempts to attack/use an enemy/potion not in the specified direction, the program will not count it as an action
  (everything on the floor doesn't move) and will prompt the user for another command.
- If the command 'f' is entered by the user, all enemies will freeze and be unable to attack the PC even within a 1 block radius of any enemy.
  The player character is able to attack and slay any enemy, once 'f' is entered again, enemy attack and random movement resumes.
- 
File arguments and the specifications that each focuses on:
layout-5floors-test1.txt - the player character is able to beat the game through the different floors via stairs
layout-5floors-test2.txt - tests the restore health potion (RH), combat between 2 enemies
