For the demo, make sure to show:
- Whenever the game restarts or starts (not when the user quits (q)), the program prompts the user to select one of 5 races.
- If the player character tries to move toward a tile that a wall/enemy/potion occupies or invalid part of the floor map,
  enters an invalid command, or attempts to attack/use an enemy/potion that does not exist in the specified direction,
  the program will not count it as an action and will prompt the user for another command.
- If the command 'f' is entered by the user, all enemies will freeze and be unable to attack the PC.
  Once 'f' is entered again, enemy attack and random movement resumes.
-
