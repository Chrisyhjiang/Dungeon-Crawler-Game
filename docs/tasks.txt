changes:
-- add a new field cellSymbol to the player.h to track the cell symbol as we need reset back this symbol after moving away from the current cell.
-- run into circular dependency on Enemy and Player classes
-- first spawnTreasure and generate Dragon to guard to avoid situation all 8 cells are occupied by character or enemies.
-- do not move Dragon
